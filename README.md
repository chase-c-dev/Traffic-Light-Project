Traffic Light Project Using Java Circuit Simulator

Traffic Light Project That Operates Inside Of The Simulator.jar.

This is a project I did in university utilizing the professors simulator.jar file they created.
I created a working circuit inside the simulator that acts as a traffic light intersection.

This program is also interactive in that it responds to user input, if you click there being an ambulance on or
no cars are currently at the intersection, the lights will respond accordingly.

To run the program:
  1. Open the simulator.jar file
  2. Click on processor design
  3. Click on load and load in the Traffic Light File
  4. Then click whatever red buttons you want and click step to see the program run
